Each service is provided with the utmost commitment to quality, transparency, and customer satisfaction. We strive to accurately represent all products and services through detailed descriptions, images, and, where applicable, instructional content. While we endeavor to ensure the availability of all listed items and scheduled workshops, unforeseen circumstances may occasionally lead to adjustments or cancellations. In such events, we commit to providing timely notification and suitable alternatives or refunds as per our discretion and applicable policies.
            </p>

The DIY kits are carefully curated to provide comprehensive materials and step-by-step guidance, making complex projects accessible to beginners while offering satisfying challenges for experienced hobbyists. These kits are designed not just to provide components, but to deliver a complete creative experience. Our workshops, whether local hands-on sessions or virtual lessons, are led by experienced artisans dedicated to sharing their knowledge and fostering a love for the craft. The pedagogical approach is practical, skill-focused, and designed to build confidence in working with wood. The scope of services may expand or contract over time as we continuously innovate and refine our offerings to better serve the woodworking community.

Our commitment to sustainability is woven into all our services, from ethical material sourcing to waste reduction in our workshop practices. We aim to provide a holistic woodworking experience that respects both the artisan and the environment. While we strive for perfection in every aspect of our service delivery, we acknowledge that human error or unforeseen technical issues may occur. In such instances, our dedicated customer support team will endeavor to resolve any issues promptly and fairly, ensuring your satisfaction remains our paramount concern.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                IN NO EVENT WILL WOODHANDCRAFT, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IN NO EVENT SHALL WOODHANDCRAFT'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THIS SITE OR FOR THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES VIA THIS SITE.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                This limitation of liability applies to all forms of damages, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other intangible losses, even if woodHandcraft has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes damages arising from: (i) the use or inability to use the Site; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information, or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Site; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the Site; or (v) any other matter relating to the Site.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                Furthermore, woodHandcraft shall not be liable for any injury, damage, or loss resulting from the improper use of tools, materials, or techniques learned through our DIY kits or workshops. Users are solely responsible for their own safety and for adhering to all safety guidelines and best practices. While we strive to provide comprehensive safety instructions, the ultimate responsibility for safe operation and handling of tools rests with the individual user. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring proper ventilation, wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and understanding the specific characteristics and hazards of the materials and tools being used.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                The limitations and exclusions of liability in these Terms apply to the fullest extent permitted by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, woodHandcraft's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">9. Indemnification</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless woodHandcraft, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Service or your use of the Site, including, but not limited to, your user contributions, any use of the Site's content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms, or your use of any information obtained from the Site.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                This indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Site. You agree to cooperate fully with woodHandcraft in the defense of any such claims. woodHandcraft reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you shall not in any event settle any matter without the written consent of woodHandcraft. This means that if you breach these Terms and it causes harm to woodHandcraft or a third party, you will be responsible for the costs and damages incurred. This includes, but is not limited to, legal fees, court costs, and any settlements or judgments paid.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                Your obligation to indemnify woodHandcraft extends to any claims arising from your improper or unsafe use of products purchased from us, including DIY kits and carving supplies, or from your participation in our workshops. By agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with woodworking and commit to indemnifying woodHandcraft against any claims related to your actions or omissions in connection with these activities. This clause is a fundamental aspect of our agreement, ensuring that woodHandcraft is protected from liabilities arising from user misconduct or negligence.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                All matters relating to the woodHandcraft Site and these Terms of Service, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, United States, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Service or the Site shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California, in each case located in Los Angeles County, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Service in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                This choice of governing law and jurisdiction is intended to provide clarity and consistency in the resolution of any disputes. By agreeing to these Terms, you irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of these courts. This means that any legal action you wish to pursue against woodHandcraft, or any legal action woodHandcraft may pursue against you, must be brought in these specified courts. This clause is designed to streamline the legal process and avoid the complexities of multi-jurisdictional litigation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, woodHandcraft reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. This ensures that our intellectual property can be protected effectively in any relevant legal forum.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">11. Severability</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                This severability clause ensures that the invalidity of one part of the Terms does not invalidate the entire agreement. The remaining provisions will continue to be binding and enforceable. This is a standard legal provision designed to preserve the enforceability of the agreement as much as possible, even if certain clauses are found to be legally problematic. It reflects our intention that these Terms should be upheld to the maximum extent permissible by law.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">12. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                The Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and our Cookies Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and woodHandcraft regarding the Site and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Site.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                This clause confirms that these documents collectively represent the complete and final agreement between you and woodHandcraft, replacing any previous discussions or agreements. It ensures that there is a clear and definitive understanding of the terms governing your use of our services. This "entire agreement" clause is crucial for preventing misunderstandings and ensuring that all parties are operating under the same set of rules and expectations. It clarifies that no other promises, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written, outside of these specified documents, are binding.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">13. Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                By continuing to access or use our Site after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the website and the Service. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. It is your responsibility to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                The frequency and nature of updates to these Terms may vary, reflecting changes in our services, legal requirements, or business practices. We are committed to maintaining transparency regarding any modifications, and the notice period for material changes is designed to allow you sufficient time to review and understand the implications of such updates. Your ongoing engagement with woodHandcraft signifies your continuous acceptance of the most current version of these Terms. This dynamic aspect of the agreement ensures that the Terms remain relevant and applicable to our evolving services and the legal landscape.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">14. Termination</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Site immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Site. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability. Termination of your account will not relieve you of any obligations to pay any outstanding fees or charges. Upon termination, your right to use the Site will immediately cease.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                Reasons for termination by woodHandcraft may include, but are not limited to, violations of our user conduct policy, fraudulent activity, non-payment of fees, or any other actions deemed harmful to the integrity of our platform or the safety of our users. We reserve the right to remove any content associated with a terminated account. This termination clause is essential for maintaining a secure and compliant environment for all users and for protecting woodHandcraft's interests.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">15. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                woodHandcraft shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance under these Terms where such failure or delay is due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                This force majeure clause protects woodHandcraft from liability for events that are outside of our control and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. While we will make reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of such events, we cannot be held responsible for delays or failures directly attributable to these unforeseen circumstances. This provision ensures that both parties understand the limitations of our ability to perform under extreme and unavoidable conditions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">16. Feedback and Suggestions</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                Any feedback, comments, ideas, improvements, or suggestions (collectively, "Suggestions") provided by you to woodHandcraft with respect to the Site or services shall remain the sole and exclusive property of woodHandcraft. We shall be free to use, copy, modify, publish, or redistribute the Suggestions for any purpose and in any way without any credit or any compensation to you.

This clause allows us to freely utilize user feedback to improve our services and products without incurring additional obligations or compensation requirements. Your valuable input helps us to continuously enhance the woodHandcraft experience for all users.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-classic-pine-brown mb-4">17. Waiver and Severability</h2>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                No waiver by woodHandcraft of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of woodHandcraft to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            </p>
            <p class="text-workshop-gray mb-4">
                If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. This ensures the maximum possible enforceability of the agreement.
